# CryptoTradingBotV2

This cryptocurrency trading bot continuously scans the cryptocurrency prices and checks whether specified trade criteria is met. Once the criteria is met, the bot will fully autonomously purchase a specified amount of crypto and wait until the sell criteria is met to resell it for a higher price.

***NOTE***: the cryptocurrency exchange used in this project is no longer available in Canada so non of the API calls work anymore
