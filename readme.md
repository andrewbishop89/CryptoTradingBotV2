CryptoTradingBotV2 Notes

1. File Organization
- As of right now the files are split up in sections based on the functions they contain. The parameters file contains a list of all the modules imported for all files excluding the files we created ourselves.

2. Function Declaration
- When declaring function, if possible include all parameter datatypes. Also include a note stating all the parameters, their expected datatype, their purpose in the function and describe the return value. The form for this will be 
    - #PARAM 'parameter name'('paramater data type'): 'parameter purpose', and
    - #RETURN ('value data type'): 'value description'
- When working on functions, also include TODO if the part is not completed yet.

3. Additional Notes
